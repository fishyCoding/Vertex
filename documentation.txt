Vertex Documentation

Overview
Vertex is a simple coding language designed for ease of use and readability. 
This documentation provides a basic guide on how to use Vertex and its key features.

Basic Syntax
Comments: Use `//` for single-line comments.
Variables: Variables can be created using the `Set` command.
    - Example: `Set x to 5` 

Operators
Increase: `Increase x by 2` translates to `x += 2`.
Subtract: `Subtract x by 1` translates to `x -= 1`.
Multiply: `Multiply x by 3` translates to `x *= 3`.
Divide: `Divide x by 4` translates to `x /= 4`.

Logging
- To output values to the console, use the `Log` command.
    - Example: `Log x` translates to `console.log(x)`.

Loops
  For Loop
    Basic For Loop: 
      Loop i to 4 
  For Each Loop**: 
      Loop i through x

While Loop
      Example: While x<10` translates to `while (x < 10) { ... }.

Breaking Loops and Other Loop Comands
    Breaking Out of a Loop: 
    - Use `Terminate` to exit a loop.
    - Use 'Skip' to continue to the next step in the loop. 
    - Use 'Terminate when i==1' or 'Skip when i>4' 

## Functions
    Use the 'Define function' command to create a function.
    - Example: `Define function greet with inputs: name` translates to `function greet(name) { ... }`.

    

### Returning Values
- Use the `Return` command to return a value from a function.
    - Example: `Return x` translates to `return x;`.

## Conditionals
- **If Statement**: 
    - Example: `if x is greater than 5` translates to `if (x > 5) { ... }`.
- **Else If Statement**: 
    - Example: `else if x is less than 2` translates to `else if (x < 2) { ... }`.
- **Else Statement**: 
    - Example: `else` translates to `else { ... }`.

## Switch Statements
- **Switch Statement**: 
    - Example: `If x is equal to 1` translates to `switch (x) { case 1: ... }`.

## Summary
Vertex is designed to be straightforward and intuitive, making it easy to learn for beginners while still being powerful enough for more advanced users.
